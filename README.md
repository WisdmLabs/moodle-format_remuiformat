# Description

Let your students focus on what matters - learning, with the all-new and intuitive Edwiser Course Formats plugin! Choose from unique course formats like Card and List.

Edwiser Course Formats plugin comes with two different layouts for your courses.

The List Format is one of the simplest course formats you can come across. Using this format, you can list your course activities in the form of lists. This format is minimalistic in design, with an option to collapse/expand course sections. The collapsible nature of List format completely removes any scope of endless scrolling across courses.

Card Format is another standout course format in the offering. Edwiser Card Format displays your courses neatly stacked as cards on your course page. This format is pleasing to the eye and also highly functional.

Note: Please use image of 34:35 size in card layout to apply proper background to cards.

   users using it bar you as the administrator - if you have not already done so.

   'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.

# Uninstallation

   not done Moodle will pick the last format in your list of formats to use but display in 'Edit settings' of the
   course the first format in the list.  You can then set the desired format.
3. Go to Site administration > Plugins > Plugin overview and go to Course Formats section, click on uninstall link for 'Edwiser Course Formats'.
4. In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'remuiformat'.
5. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

# Files Information
Languages
---------
The remuiformat/lang folder contains the language files for the format.

Note that existing formats store their language strings in the main
moodle.php, which you can also do, but this separate file is recommended
for contributed formats.

Of course you can have other folders as well as English etc. if you want to
provide multiple languages.

Styles
------
The file remuiformat/styles.css contains the CSS styles for the format.
